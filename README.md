# Reapyr: Develop with the simplicity of Python, and the performance of C/C++ !

Reapyr is a set of [Python](https://www.python.org/) bindings for the amazing [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) game library. 

It provides both [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) bindings as well as bindings for [Shedskin](https://shedskin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - which is a [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) capable of converting Python code to C++.

Reapyr aims to run on as many platforms as possible - including desktop and mobile targets.
